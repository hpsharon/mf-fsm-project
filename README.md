# My FSM Project

This project is a Finite State Machine (FSM) builder for React.js applications. It includes components for managing and visualizing state transitions and integrates with a backend server to persist state.


## Features

- Define state machines with various configurations.
- Visualize state transitions using the FSM builder.
- Persist state transitions to a backend server.
- Mock API responses for offline development.
- Timer support for delayed state transitions.
- Manage multiple state machines simultaneously.
